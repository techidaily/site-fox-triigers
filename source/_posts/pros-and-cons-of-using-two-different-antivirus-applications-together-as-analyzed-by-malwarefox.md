Older viruses gave birth to more potent variants. Consequently, the recent decades saw worsening attacks from viruses. The Conficker virus in the early 2000s and the WannaCry crisis early in 2017 underlined the importance of security.

Security applications are working hard to keep up with new threats. Antiviruses are evolving to become complete security suites. Operating systems began actively developing features surrounding security as well.

Consumers are now more aware of the risks. So, more and more users are beginning to prioritize security. Some may even install multiple programs to ensure safety.

Is having two or more antiviruses help protect your computer?

## One is Better than Two?

![](https://malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/1-e1509730284596.jpg)

You might think that running multiple security suites protect your machine better. After all, “two heads are better than one.” However, in security applications, less is more.

Running multiple antiviruses is resource intensive. Each security program runs different processes. Applications need access to the network connection, memory usage, and computing power to name a few. These things on top of your other apps are already taxing on your computer. Now imagine two or more antiviruses eating up these resources.

![](https://malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/martial-arts-couple-fight.png)

Security programs “fighting” over system resources will slow down any machine. Additionally, two antiviruses running at the same time will get in each other’s way. They may even make each other inoperable.

Quarantine and removing viruses may take a while as well. In detecting and dealing with threats, the faster, the better. However, two programs trying to quarantine a virus will take time. Each antivirus product has its criteria and quarantine process. When one antivirus quarantines a threat, the other may throw false positives.

Moreover, some antiviruses may return false detection. Other security programs may identify files from another antivirus as a threat. Other security applications may locate processes of another antivirus programs as suspicious. Several antiviruses, such as Kaspersky Antivirus, will outright reject other security programs.

So, what can you do to ensure full protection of your computer?

## Virus vs. Malware

To better protect your computer, you must understand the difference between a virus and malware.

A [malicious software or malware](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=http%3A%2F%2Fsearchsecurity.techtarget.com%2Fdefinition%2Fmalware) is an umbrella term for programs that threatens any systems. There are [several types of malware](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/). Viruses, adware, spyware, trojan horses, and worms are classic variants of malware. More recent examples of malware are bots, rootkits, [spyware](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/), and [ransomware](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/). The new variations are known to be more potent.

A [virus](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=http%3A%2F%2Fsearchsecurity.techtarget.com%2Fdefinition%2Fvirus) is a type of malicious software. It can rapidly reproduce itself on other host systems. Infections can spread over a network or even emails. Early versions of viruses would destroy data on your computer. Some may also take a significant amount of space on your computer memory.

### Past Attacks

In the past, cybercriminals act more like vandals. Their goals were to create annoyance or inconvenience by damaging files and parts of the system.In contrast, recent attacks have far-reaching damages. Hackers now aim to monetize their efforts.

For example, Conficker attacks in the early 2000’s were estimated to have caused around [$200 million](http://www.zdnet.com/article/confickers-estimated-economic-cost-9-1-billion/) in economic damages. On the other hand, WannaCry crisis caused more significant losses. It spread to at least 150 countries. The malware targeted most Windows users especially those using older versions.

It took hold of systems of more prominent organizations as well. FedEx, Petrobras, Portugal Telecom, Renault, and Telefonica were some of the private agencies affected. There was an attack on computers of universities in China, Hungary, Canada, Indonesia, Greece, and India as well.

Worse, public institutions such as the National Health Services in the United Kingdom and Scotland saw their operations frozen. Even government agencies and public services in India, Sweden, Russia, and Romania were severely impaired. It was estimated to have caused as much as [$4 billion in damages](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/wannacry-ransomware-attacks-wannacry-virus-losses/).

So, if there are various threats on the Internet, why do multiple antiviruses won’t work?

## Antivirus + Anti-Malware

![](https://malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/3.jpeg)

Instead of running different antiviruses, install a good anti-malware instead. [What’s the difference?](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/)

Antiviruses [often](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/) protect you from known threats, specifically viruses. Some are full suite as well. Antiviruses are meant to run in the background. It works by profoundly rooting itself in your system. During scans, it can efficiently identify dangerous software.

On the other hand, anti-malware applications are focused on identifying, protecting, and deleting several types of malware. Some antiviruses come packaged with anti-malware as well. However, installing a dedicated anti-malware alongside your main security software creates stronger layers of protection. Developers of specialized anti-malware applications focus on building robust protection from malicious software.
