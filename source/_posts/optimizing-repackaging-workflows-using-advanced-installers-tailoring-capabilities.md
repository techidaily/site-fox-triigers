## Streamlining Repackaging Processes with Advanced Installer's Customization Feature

I recently encountered a scenario where a software for repackaging required the VC++ runtime and other runtimes.

It's important to note that packages that require runtime dependencies should ideally have those runtimes already configured on the machine. This practice ensures that the runtimes won't be installed by the repackaged software, resulting in a cleaner and more efficient installation process. This adherence to best practices enhances the overall quality and reliability of the repackaging process.

![Important](https://cdn.advancedinstaller.com/svg/common/IconMessageInfo.svg)You can check our article regarding the [Repackaging best practices](https://tools.techidaily.com/advancedinstaller/products/) for ensuring a smooth and error-free application repackaging process.

It's no secret that the [Windows Sandbox](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/application-security/application-isolation/windows-sandbox/windows-sandbox-overview "Windows Sandbox") environment delivers optimal results for the repackaging process. With its lightweight environment and minimal noise capture, it has become the go-to choice for quick repackaging tasks.

However, it has become increasingly evident that allowing VM customization before the initial scan, particularly in Sandbox environments, is crucial. Presently, Windows Sandbox only permits one instance to run. Consequently, when a package requires customization, such as runtime installation, utilizing Windows Sandbox for the repackaging process becomes impractical.

Fortunately, with Advanced Installer, users have the flexibility to wait before installing the package. This grants ample time to customize and prepare the sandbox environment to suit specific requirements. Whether it involves installing required runtimes, configuring system settings, or making other necessary adjustments, Advanced Installer's "Prompt and wait before installing packages" option simplifies the process.

During this preparatory phase, users can fine-tune the machine by installing necessary runtimes or making essential adjustments. Subsequently, Advanced Installer accurately captures the initial state of the machine, ensuring compatibility and minimizing any potential issues.

This additional step is crucial due to the absence of snapshotting support in Windows Sandbox during the machine preparation phase preceding the scanning process.

Here's to smoother repackaging processes ahead!
