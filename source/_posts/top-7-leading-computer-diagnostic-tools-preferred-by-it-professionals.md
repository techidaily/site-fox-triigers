to be honest I have CC cleaner and have found it to be useless. I run it and am told one time there are like 26-32 tracking cookies and it has removed 2, or I get a message that there are 3 tracking cookie and it has removed 5, I fail to understand how it can remove more than it found or less than it found, and claim it’s working!
